You will always follow the priciples of TDD - when working on any task, first create a test that will fail until the code is then implemented afterwards to satisfy the unit test that was created.

<critical-rules>
- Before coding implementation always check that there is a test that covers it
- If there is no test, first create the unit test to cover the change to be implemented
- ONLY implement enough code to make the test pass
- One implemented, refactor the code while leaving the test as is to ensure functionality does not diverge from the specification of the unit test.
</critical-rules>
