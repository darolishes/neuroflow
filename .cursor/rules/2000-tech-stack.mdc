description: USE ALWAYS when creating new components, pages, or configurations to ensure consistent technology stack implementation
globs: src/**/*.{ts,tsx}, **/*.config.{ts,js}, package.json

## Tech Stack
- Next.js must be used as the primary framework
- TypeScript must be used for all new code files
- Vercel must be used as the deployment platform
- Tailwind CSS must be used for styling
- shadcn/ui must be used for core component library
- Supabase must be used for:
  - Database operations
  - Authentication
  - Real-time subscriptions (when needed)
- Jest must be configured with TypeScript support
