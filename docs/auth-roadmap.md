# Authentication Improvement Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements to our authentication system based on the analysis of our current implementation. The improvements are organized into phases with specific tasks and acceptance criteria.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements

**Timeline**: Current Sprint

### 1. Next.js Middleware Implementation

**Description**: Replace the client-side route protection with server-side middleware for more consistent and secure route protection.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create middleware.ts in the root directory
- [ ] Implement Supabase middleware client
- [ ] Configure route protection based on authentication state
- [ ] Test middleware with protected and public routes

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Server-side route protection works consistently across all protected routes
- Redirects occur before page content is loaded
- Middleware properly handles authentication token validation

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

**Description**: Improve error handling for authentication operations with user-friendly messages and consistent patterns.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create auth-errors.ts utility file
- [ ] Map Supabase error codes to user-friendly messages
- [ ] Update auth context to use the new error handling utilities
- [ ] Implement toast notifications for auth errors

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All authentication errors are handled gracefully
- Users receive clear, helpful error messages
- Error handling is consistent across all auth operations

## Phase 2: Security & Session Management

**Timeline**: Next Sprint

### 3. Session Management Improvements

**Description**: Enhance session handling with token refresh mechanisms and better session state management.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement automatic token refresh
- [ ] Add session expiry detection
- [ ] Create session timeout handling
- [ ] Update auth context to handle session events

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Sessions remain valid as long as user is active
- Expired sessions are handled gracefully
- Users are prompted to reauthenticate when necessary

### 4. Security Enhancements

**Description**: Add additional security measures such as rate limiting for auth endpoints and CSRF protection.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement rate limiting for auth attempts
- [ ] Add CSRF protection to forms
- [ ] Enhance password validation rules
- [ ] Implement secure HTTP headers

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Auth endpoints are protected against brute force attacks
- CSRF attacks are prevented
- Password requirements meet security standards
- All security headers are properly configured

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

**Timeline**: Future Sprints

### 5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Description**: Implement a role-based permission system for more granular access control.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Design role and permission schema
- [ ] Create database tables for roles and permissions
- [ ] Implement role checking in middleware
- [ ] Create UI components for role-based content

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Different user roles have appropriate access levels
- Admin users can manage roles and permissions
- UI elements are conditionally rendered based on permissions
- API endpoints respect role-based access controls

### 6. Profile Management Integration

**Description**: Better integrate user profiles with the authentication system.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create or update profiles table
- [ ] Implement profile creation on signup
- [ ] Create profile update functionality
- [ ] Add profile completion indicators

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- User profiles are automatically created on signup
- Users can update their profiles
- Profile data is securely managed
- Applications shows profile completion status

## Testing & Documentation

**Ongoing throughout all phases**

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all auth utilities and functions
- Integration tests for protected routes
- End-to-end tests for authentication flows
- Security testing (OWASP compliance checks)

### Documentation Updates

- Update README with authentication details
- Create internal documentation for developers
- Document security practices and considerations
- Create user documentation for authentication features
