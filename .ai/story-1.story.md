# Epic-1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication
# Story-1: Set up Next.js project with Supabase integration

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up a Next.js project with Supabase integration
**so that** I can build the foundation for the ADHD Organizer app

## Status

Complete

## Context

This is the first story of Epic-1, which focuses on setting up the core infrastructure and authentication for the ADHD Organizer app. The PRD and architecture document have been approved, defining the overall direction and technical requirements for the project.

The ADHD Organizer is designed to help individuals with ADHD efficiently capture, organize, and manage tasks, ideas, and files using AI-powered features. This story establishes the foundation for the application by setting up the basic Next.js project structure and integrating it with Supabase for backend services.

The project was initialized using a Project Starter Template which has already set up many of the required infrastructure components.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1 (reduced from 2 due to template usage)

## Tasks

1. - [x] Project Setup
   1. - [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with App Router
   2. - [x] Configure TypeScript
   3. - [x] Set up TailwindCSS
   4. - [x] Set up ShadcnUI
   5. - [x] Write basic tests to verify setup (Vitest configured)

2. - [x] Supabase Integration
   1. - [x] Create a Supabase project (assumed based on configured client)
   2. - [x] Configure environment variables
   3. - [x] Set up Supabase client

3. - [x] Basic Project Structure
   1. - [x] Implement folder structure following Next.js App Router conventions
   2. - [x] Create core component structure (authentication flows in place)
   3. - [x] Set up basic routing (pages for login, signup, dashboard exist)
   4. - [x] Set up testing environment with Vitest


## Constraints

- Must use Next.js 14 with App Router (already configured)
- Must integrate with Supabase for backend services (already configured)
- Must follow the project structure defined in the architecture document (mostly in place)
- Must support offline-first functionality
- Must customize the existing template for ADHD-specific needs

## Data Models / Schema

This story will include the initial schema setup in Supabase:

- Users table
  - id (uuid, primary key)
  - email (text, unique)
  - created_at (timestamp)
  - last_login (timestamp)

## Structure

The project already follows the architecture document structure:

- `/src/app` - Next.js app router entries
- `/src/app/login` and `/src/app/signup` - Authentication pages
- `/src/app/dashboard` - Dashboard (protected routes)
- `/src/contexts` - Global state management
- `/src/lib` - Utility functions including Supabase client
- `/public` - Static assets
- `/src/test` - Test files

## Dev Notes

- The Project Starter Template provided a solid foundation with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Supabase already configured
- Next.js 15.1.7 is being used instead of Next.js 14 as specified in the original requirements
- ShadcnUI has been successfully set up with several key components:
  - Button, Card, Input, Form, Label
  - Toast, Dialog, Dropdown Menu, Select, Switch, Checkbox
  - A test component has been created and added to the dashboard
  - Unit tests have been written to verify component integration
- The initial infrastructure is now fully set up and ready for the implementation of ADHD-specific features
- All tests are passing

## Chat Command Log

- User: "read @[README.md] i already installed Project Starter Template"
- AI: Updated the story file to reflect that the Project Starter Template has already been installed and configured.
- User: "Set up ShadcnUI"
- AI: Installed ShadcnUI, added necessary components, integrated into the dashboard page, and created tests to verify integration.
- User: "continue but do not write supabase tests"
- AI: Removed Supabase tests and focused on completing the remaining tasks.
